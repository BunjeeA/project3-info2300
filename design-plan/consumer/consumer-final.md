## Self-Reflection

I learned how to adapt quickly. There were a bunch of times that where I had to revise before the next deadline and I learned how to think differently on the fly.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

I've really enjoyed this class. After 1300 I had a similar feeling and I'm glad that I've enjoyed 2300 just as much.
