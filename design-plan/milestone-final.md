**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.

Updated database schema


## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
