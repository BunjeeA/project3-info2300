I edited my code to make the edit form work with media and fixed the filter by tag issue I had on the previous milestone.

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment.

> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

I feel like I leanred how to work with databases and file uploads much better. Next time, I would make sure my database schema is excatly how I want it because we had to change it a couple times and rework code.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

I am much more confident with php coding and front end in general. I had to reference class material a lot in the past, but this is no longer the case.
